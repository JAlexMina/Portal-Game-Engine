My program does not crash,
It runs on department machines at 20+ FPS,
Moving the mouse pans the camera,
Pressing certain keys moves the camera.

My main implimentation for the final was to 
add portals! They are able to show what you 
would see if there was an actual portal to a 
different location in space.

My second feature is sound of which I have 2 sound 
effects and 1 sound track that loops.
